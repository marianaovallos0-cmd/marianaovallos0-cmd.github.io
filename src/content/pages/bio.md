## About Me

Hi, my name is Mariana.

I am a systems engineering student interested in cybersecurity, databases, and practical technology projects.

I enjoy learning new things, working on real-world solutions, and improving my technical skills step by step.

My goal is to build secure, efficient, and meaningful systems that solve real problems.
